============================
Optional Many2One popup edit
============================

Change the default behaviour of the edit mode when opening a popup form to see the details of a Many2One field.
By default the popup form is in edit mode when the originating form is also in edit mode.

To enable editing on a Many2One widget popup form, include 'no_popup_edit': False
in the widget options.

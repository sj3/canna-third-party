Description
-----------
This module adds a css class to change a Form Sheet view
to cover the full screen.

You can activate the Full Screen view by the creation of an
inherited view with the following content:
::

    <xpath expr="//sheet" position="attributes">
        <attribute name="class">oe_form_sheet_full_screen</attribute>
    </xpath>

Install the 'web_sheet_full_width' module if you want to have a full screen
behaviour in all sheets.

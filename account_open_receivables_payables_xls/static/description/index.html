                <br><br>This module adds the 'Open Receivables/Payables by Period' report to the Accounting Partners reports.
                <br>The report is available in PDF and XLS format.
                <br><br>You can filter on partner or general accounts.
                <br>All general accounts which can be reconciled can be used as a filter (hence not only type 'receivable' or 'payable').
                <br>As a consequence you can also use this report to get an overview of all 'Open Items' on a per partner basis.

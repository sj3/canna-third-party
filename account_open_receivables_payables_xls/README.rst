Description
===========

This module adds the 'Open Receivables/Payables by Period' report to the
Accounting Partners reports.
The report is available in PDF and XLS format.

You can filter on partner or general accounts.
All general accounts which can be reconciled can be used as a filter (hence not only type 'receivable' or 'payable').
As a consequence you can also use this report to get an overview of all 'Open Items' on a per partner basis.

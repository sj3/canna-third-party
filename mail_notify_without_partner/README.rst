===============================================
Mail notification without the need of a partner
===============================================

In Odoo the chatter always needs a partner to notify it. But if e.g. a lead is created from website_crm it's weird to create
a partner just so you can respond to it. In a normal situation a partner is only created after it's converted to a opportunity.
With this module you're not required to create a partner.

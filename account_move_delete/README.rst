Delete Journal Entries
======================

This module allows to remove Journal Entries which have been posted previously
and hence already received a number.
This is not a recommended practice, hence we recommend to uninstall this module immediately after e.g.
some data cleaning operation.


Configuration
=============

The user has to belong to the *Allow "Delete Journal Entry"* group.
